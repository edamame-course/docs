<h2 id="what-is-the-shell">What is the shell?</h2>

<p>The <em>shell</em> is a program that presents a command line interface
which allows you to control your computer using commands entered
with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to learn about the shell.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For most bioinformatics tools, you have to use the shell. There is no
graphical interface. If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics you’re
going to need to use the shell.</li>
  <li>The shell gives you <em>power</em>. The command line gives you the power to do your work more efficiently and
more quickly.  When you need to do things tens to hundreds of times,
knowing how to use the shell is transformative.</li>
  <li>To use remote computers or cloud computing, you need to use the shell.</li>
  <li>We’re going to use it in this class, for all of the reasons above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unix is user-friendly. It’s just very selective about who its friends are.</p>

<p>Today we’re going to go through how to access Unix/Linux and some of the basic
shell commands.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-access-the-shell">How to access the shell</h2>

<p>The shell is already available on Mac and Linux. For Windows, you’ll
have to download a separate program.</p>

<h2 id="mac">Mac</h2>
<p>On Mac the shell is available through Terminal<br />
Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Terminal<br />
Go ahead and drag the Terminal application to your Dock for easy access.</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>For Windows, we’re going to be using gitbash.<br />
Download and install <a href="http://msysgit.github.io">gitbash</a>
Open up the program.</p>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>Well, you should be set.</p>

<h2 id="starting-with-the-shell">Starting with the shell</h2>

<p>We will spend most of our time learning about the basics of the shell
by manipulating some experimental data.</p>

<p>Now we’re going to download the data for the tutorial. For this you’ll need
internet access, because you’re going to get it off the web.  </p>

<p>Open the shell</p>

<p>Enter the command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/edamame-course/edamame-data.git
</code></pre>

<p>This command will grab all of the data needed for this workshop from
the internet.  (We’re not going to talk about git right now, but it’s a tool for
doing version control.)</p>

<p>Now let’s go in to that directory
    cd edamame-data
This stands for ‘change directory’</p>

<p>In this directory, there should be some things we just downloaded.
Let’s check. Type:
    ls
ls stands for ‘list’ and it lists the contents of a directory.</p>

<p>There’s a few directories there, but not too much. Let’s go look in the shell
lesson.
    cd shell
    ls</p>

<p>In there, all mixed up together are files and directories/folders. If we want to
know which is which, we can type:
    ls -F
Anything with a “/” after it is a directory.<br />
Things with a “*” after them are programs.<br />
It there’s nothing there it’s a file.</p>

<p>You can also use the command <code>ls -l</code> to see whether items in a
directory are files or directories. <code>ls -l</code> gives a lot more
information too, such as the size of the file</p>

<p>So, we can see that we have several files, directories and a program. Great!</p>

<h2 id="the-unix-directory-file-structure-aka-where-am-i">The Unix directory file structure (a.k.a. where am I?)</h2>

<p>As you’ve already just seen, you can move around in different directories
or folders at the command line. Why would you want to do this, rather
than just navigating around the normal way.</p>

<p>When you’re working with bioinformatics programs, you’re working with
your data and it’s key to be able to have that data in the right place
and make sure the program has access to the data. Many of the problems
people run in to with command line bioinformatics programs is not having the
data in the place the program expects it to be.</p>

<h2 id="moving-around-the-file-system">Moving around the file system</h2>

<p>Let’s practice moving around a bit.</p>

<p>We’re going to work in that <code>shell</code> directory we just downloaded.</p>

<p>First let’s navigate there using the regular way by clicking on the different folders.</p>

<p>First we did something like go to the folder of our username. Then we opened
‘edamame-data’ then ‘shell’</p>

<p>Let’s draw out how that went.</p>

<p>Now let’s draw some of the other files and folders we could have clicked on.</p>

<p>This is called a hierarchical file system structure, like an upside down tree
with root (/) at the base that looks like this.</p>

<p><img src="img/shell/Slide1.jpg" alt="Unix" /></p>

<p>That (/) at the base is often also called the ‘top’ level.</p>

<p>When you are working at your computer or log in to a remote computer,
you are on one of the branches of that tree, your home directory (/home/username)</p>

<p>Now let’s go do that same navigation at the command line.</p>

<p>Type
    cd
This put’s you in your home directory. This folder here.</p>

<p>Now using <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>, go in to the ‘shell’ directory and list its contents.</p>

<p>Let’s also check to see where we are. Sometimes when we’re wandering around
in the file system, it’s easy to lose track of where we are and get lost.</p>

<p>If you want to know what directory you’re currently in, type
    pwd
This stands for ‘print working directory’. The directory you’re currently
working in.</p>

<p>What if we want to move back up and out of the ‘data’ directory? Can we just
type ‘edamame-data’? Try it and see what happens.</p>

<p>To go ‘back up a level’ we need to use <code>..</code></p>

<p>Type
    cd ..</p>

<p>Now do <code>ls</code> and <code>pwd</code>. See now that we went back up in to the ‘edamame’
directory. <code>..</code> just means go back up a level.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Now we’re going to try a hunt.<br />
Move around in the ‘hidden’ directory and try to find the file ‘youfoundit.txt’
***</p>

<h2 id="arguments">Arguments</h2>

<p>Most programs take additional arguments that control their exact
behavior. For example, <code>-F</code> and <code>-l</code> are arguments to <code>ls</code>.  The <code>ls</code>
program, like many programs, take a lot of arguments. But how do we
know what the options are to particular commands?</p>

<p>Most commonly used shell programs have a manual. You can access the
manual using the <code>man</code> program. Try entering:</p>

<pre><code>man ls
</code></pre>

<p>This will open the manual page for <code>ls</code>. Use the space key to go
forward and b to go backwards. When you are done reading, just hit <code>q</code>
to quit.</p>

<p>Programs that are run from the shell can get extremely complicated. To
see an example, open up the manual page for the <code>find</code> program.
No one can possibly learn all of
these arguments, of course. So you will probably find yourself
referring back to the manual page frequently.</p>

<h2 id="examining-the-contents-of-other-directories">Examining the contents of other directories</h2>

<p>By default, the <code>ls</code> commands lists the contents of the working
directory (i.e. the directory you are in). You can always find the
directory you are in using the <code>pwd</code> command. However, you can also
give <code>ls</code> the names of other directories to view. Navigate to the
home directory if you are not already there.</p>

<p>Type:</p>

<pre><code>cd
</code></pre>

<p>Then enter the command:</p>

<pre><code>ls edamame-data
</code></pre>

<p>This will list the contents of the <code>edamame-data</code> directory without
you having to navigate there.</p>

<p>The <code>cd</code> command works in a similar way. Try entering:</p>

<pre><code>cd
cd edamame-data/shell/hidden
</code></pre>

<p>and you will jump directly to <code>hidden</code> without having to go through
the intermediate directory.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Try finding the ‘anotherfile.txt’ file without changing directories.
<em>**</em></p>

<h2 id="full-vs-relative-paths">Full vs. Relative Paths</h2>

<p>The <code>cd</code> command takes an argument which is the directory
name. Directories can be specified using either a <em>relative</em> path or a
full <em>path</em>. The directories on the computer are arranged into a
hierarchy. The full path tells you where a directory is in that
hierarchy. Navigate to the home directory. Now, enter the <code>pwd</code>
command and you should see:</p>

<pre><code>/home/username
</code></pre>

<p>which is the full name of your home directory. This tells you that you
are in a directory called <code>username</code>, which sits inside a directory called
<code>home</code> which sits inside the very top directory in the hierarchy. The
very top of the hierarchy is a directory called <code>/</code> which is usually
referred to as the <em>root directory</em>. So, to summarize: <code>username</code> is a
directory in <code>home</code> which is a directory in <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>Now enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>cd /home/username/edamame-data/shell/hidden
</code></pre>

<p>This jumps to <code>hidden</code>. Now go back to the home directory (cd). We saw
earlier that the command:</p>

<pre><code>cd edamame-data/shell/hidden
</code></pre>

<p>had the same effect - it took us to the <code>hidden</code> directory. But,
instead of specifying the full path
(<code>/home/username/edamame-data/shell</code>), we specified a <em>relative path</em>. In
other words, we specified the path relative to our current
directory. A full path always starts with a <code>/</code>. A relative path does
not.</p>

<p>A relative path is like getting directions
from someone on the street. They tell you to “go right at the Stop sign, and
then turn left on Main Street”. That works great if you’re standing there
together, but not so well if you’re trying to tell someone how to get there
from another country. A full path is like GPS coordinates.
It tells you exactly where something
is no matter where you are right now.</p>

<p>You can usually use either a full path or a relative path
depending on what is most convenient. If we are in the home directory,
it is more convenient to just enter the relative path since it
involves less typing.</p>

<p>Over time, it will become easier for you to keep a mental note of the
structure of the directories that you are using and how to quickly
navigate amongst them.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Short Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Now, list the contents of the /bin directory. Do you see anything
familiar in there?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saving-time-with-shortcuts-wild-cards-and-tab-completion">Saving time with shortcuts, wild cards, and tab completion</h2>

<h3 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h3>

<p>There are some shortcuts which you should know about. Dealing with the
home directory is very common. So, in the shell the tilde character,
“”~””, is a shortcut for your home directory. Navigate to the <code>edamame</code>
directory:</p>

<pre><code>cd
cd edamame-data
cd shell
</code></pre>

<p>Then enter the command:</p>

<pre><code>ls ~
</code></pre>

<p>This prints the contents of your home directory, without you having to
type the full path. The shortcut <code>..</code> always refers to the directory
above your current directory. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>ls ..
</code></pre>

<p>prints the contents of the <code>/home/username/edamame-data</code>. You can chain
these together, so:</p>

<pre><code>ls ../../
</code></pre>

<p>prints the contents of <code>/home/username</code> which is your home
directory. Finally, the special directory <code>.</code> always refers to your
current directory. So, <code>ls</code>, <code>ls .</code>, and <code>ls ././././.</code> all do the
same thing, they print the contents of the current directory. This may
seem like a useless shortcut right now, but we’ll see when it is
needed in a little while.</p>

<p>To summarize, while you are in the <code>shell</code> directory, the commands
<code>ls ~</code>, <code>ls ~/.</code>, <code>ls ../../</code>, and <code>ls /home/username</code> all do exactly the
same thing. These shortcuts are not necessary, they are provided for
your convenience.</p>

<h3 id="our-data-set-fastq-files">Our data set: FASTQ files</h3>

<p>We did an experiment and want to look at the bacterial communities
of mice in two treatments using 16S sequencing. We have 10 mice in
one treatment and 9 in another.each treatment. We also sequenced a Mock community, so we can
check the quality of our data. So, we have 20 samples all together and
we’ve done paired-end MiSeq sequencing.</p>

<p>We get our data back from the sequencing center as FASTQ files, and
we stick them all in a folder called MiSeq. This data is actually
the data we’re going to use for several sections of the course,
and it’s data generated by Pat Schloss.</p>

<p>We want to be able to look at these files and do some things with them.</p>

<h3 id="wild-cards">Wild cards</h3>

<p>Navigate to the <code>~/edamame-data/shell/MiSeq</code> directory. This
directory contains our FASTQ files and some other ones
we’ll need for analyses. If we type <code>ls</code>,
we will see that there are a bunch of files with long file names.
Some of the end with .fastq</p>

<p>The <code>*</code> character is a shortcut for “everything”. Thus, if
you enter <code>ls *</code>, you will see all of the contents of a given
directory. Now try this command:</p>

<pre><code>ls *fastq
</code></pre>

<p>This lists every file that ends with a <code>fastq</code>. This command:</p>

<pre><code>ls /usr/bin/*.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Lists every file in <code>/usr/bin</code> that ends in the characters <code>.sh</code>.</p>

<p>We have paired end sequencing, so for every sample we have two files. If we
want to just see the list of the files for the forward direction sequencing
we can use:</p>

<pre><code>ls *R1*fastq
</code></pre>

<p>lists every file in the current directory whose name contains the
number <code>R1</code>, and ends with <code>fastq</code>. There are twenty such files which
we would expect because we have 20 samples.</p>

<p>So how does this actually work? Well…when the shell (bash) sees a
word that contains the <code>*</code> character, it automatically looks for filenames
that match the given pattern. In this case, it identified four such
files. Then, it replaced the <code>*R1*fastq</code> with the list of files, separated
by spaces. In other words, the two commands:</p>

<pre><code>ls *R1*fastq
ls F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq F3D141_S207_L001_R1_001.fastq (list the rest)
</code></pre>

<p>are exactly identical. The <code>ls</code> command cannot tell the difference
between these two things.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Short Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Do each of the following using a single <code>ls</code> command without
navigating to a different directory.</p>

<ol>
  <li>List all of the files in <code>/bin</code> that start with the letter ‘c</li>
  <li>List all of the files in <code>/bin</code> that contain the letter ‘a’</li>
  <li>List all of the files in <code>/bin</code> that end with the letter ‘o’</li>
</ol>

<p>BONUS: List all of the files in ‘/bin’ that contain the letter ‘a’ or ‘c’</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="tab-completion">Tab Completion</h3>

<p>Navigate to the home directory. Typing out directory names can waste a
lot of time. When you start typing out the name of a directory, then
hit the tab key, the shell will try to fill in the rest of the
directory name. For example, enter:</p>

<pre><code>cd e&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The shell will fill in the rest of the directory name for
<code>edamame-data</code>. Now go to edamame-data/shell/MiSeq</p>

<pre><code>ls F3D&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you hit the first tab, nothing happens. The reason is that there
are multiple directories in the home directory which start with
<code>F3D</code>. Thus, the shell does not know which one to fill in. When you hit
tab again, the shell will list the possible choices.</p>

<p>Tab completion can also fill in the names of programs. For example,
enter <code>e&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</code>. You will see the name of every program that
starts with an <code>e</code>. One of those is <code>echo</code>. If you enter <code>ec&lt;tab&gt;</code> you
will see that tab completion works.</p>

<h2 id="command-history">Command History</h2>

<p>You can easily access previous commands.  Hit the up arrow.
Hit it again.  You can step backwards through your command history.
The down arrow takes your forwards in the command history.</p>

<p>^-C will cancel the command you are writing, and give you a fresh prompt.</p>

<p>^-R will do a reverse-search through your command history.  This
is very useful.</p>

<p>You can also review your recent commands with the <code>history</code> command.  Just enter:</p>

<pre><code>history
</code></pre>

<p>to see a numbered list of recent commands, including this just issues
<code>history</code> command.  You can reuse one of these commands directly by
referring to the number of that command.</p>

<p>If your history looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>259  ls *
260  ls /usr/bin/*.sh
261  ls *R1*fastq
</code></pre>

<p>then you could repeat command #260 by simply entering:</p>

<pre><code>!260
</code></pre>

<p>(that’s an exclamation mark).</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Short Exercise</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the line number in your history for the last exercise (listing
files in /bin) and reissue that command.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="examining-files">Examining Files</h2>

<p>We now know how to switch directories, run programs, and look at the
contents of directories, but how do we look at the contents of files?</p>

<p>The easiest way to examine a file is to just print out all of the
contents using the program <code>cat</code>. Enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>cat F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq
</code></pre>

<p>This prints out the contents of the <code>F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq</code> file.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Short Exercises</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Print out the contents of the <code>~/edamame-data/shell/MiSeq/stability.files</code>
file. What does this file contain?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without changing directories, (you should still be in <code>edamame-data</code>),
use one short command to print the contents of all of the files in
the <code>/home/username/edamame-data/shell/MiSeq</code> directory.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Make sure we’re in the right place for the next set of the lessons. We
want to be in the <code>shell</code> directory. Check if you’re there with <code>pwd</code>
and if not navigate there. One way to do that would be</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/edamame-data/shell/MiSeq
</code></pre>

<p><code>cat</code> is a terrific program, but when the file is really big, it can
be annoying to use. The program, <code>less</code>, is useful for this
case. Enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>less F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq
</code></pre>

<p><code>less</code> opens the file, and lets you navigate through it. The commands
are identical to the <code>man</code> program.</p>

<p><strong>Some commands in <code>less</code></strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>“space”</td>
      <td>to go forward</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“b”</td>
      <td>to go backwarsd</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“g”</td>
      <td>to go to the beginning</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“G”</td>
      <td>to go to the end</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“q”</td>
      <td>to quit</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code>less</code> also gives you a way of searching through files. Just hit the
“/” key to begin a search. Enter the name of the word you would like
to search for and hit enter. It will jump to the next location where
that word is found. Try searching the <code>dictionary.txt</code> file for the
word “cat”. If you hit “/” then “enter”, <code>less</code> will just repeat
the previous search. <code>less</code> searches from the current location and
works its way forward. If you are at the end of the file and search
for the word “cat”, <code>less</code> will not find it. You need to go to the
beginning of the file and search.</p>

<p>For instance, let’s search for the sequence <code>1101:14341</code> in our file.
You can see that we go right to that sequence and can see
what it looks like.</p>

<p>Remember, the <code>man</code> program actually uses <code>less</code> internally and
therefore uses the same commands, so you can search documentation
using “/” as well!</p>

<p>There’s another way that we can look at files, and in this case, just
look at part of them. This can be particularly useful if we just want
to see the beginning or end of the file, or see how it’s formatted.</p>

<p>The commands are <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> and they just let you look at
the beginning and end of a file respectively.</p>

<p>head F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq
tail F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq</p>

<p>The <code>-n</code> option to either of these commands can be used to print the
first or last <code>n</code> lines of a file. To print the first/last line of the
file use:</p>

<p>head -n 1 F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq
tail -n 1 F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq</p>

<h2 id="searching-files">Searching files</h2>

<p>We showed a little how to search within a file using <code>less</code>. We can also
search within files without even opening them, using <code>grep</code>. Grep is a command-line
utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a string or regular expression.
Let’s give it a try!</p>

<p>Let’s search for that sequence 1101:14341 in the F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq file.</p>

<pre><code>grep 1101:14341 F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq
</code></pre>

<p>We get back the whole line that had ‘1101:14341’ in it. What if we wanted all
four lines, the whole part of that FASTQ sequence, back instead.</p>

<pre><code>grep -A 3 1101:14341 F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-A</code> flag stands for “after match” so it’s returning the line that
matches plus the three after it. The <code>-B</code> flag returns that number of lines
before the match.</p>

<p>** Exercise **</p>

<p>Search for the sequence ‘TTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGT’ in the
F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq file and in the output have the
sequence name and the sequence. e.g.<br />
@M00967:43:000000000-A3JHG:1:2114:11799:28499 1:N:0:188<br />
TACGGAGGATGCGAGCGTTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGTGCGTAGGCGGGATGCAG</p>

<p>Search for that sequence in all the FASTQ files.</p>

<h2 id="redirection">Redirection</h2>

<p>We’re excited we have all these sequences that we care about that we
just got from the FASTQ files. That is a really important motif
that is going to help us answer our important question. But all those
sequences just went whizzing by with grep. How can we capture them?</p>

<p>We can do that with something called “redirection”. The idea is that
we’re redirecting the output to the terminal (all the stuff that went
whizzing by) to something else. In this case, we want to print it
to a file, so that we can look at it later.</p>

<p>The redirection command for putting something in a file is <code>&gt;</code></p>

<p>Let’s try it out and put all the sequences that contain ‘TTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGT’
from all the files in to another file called ‘good-data.txt’</p>

<pre><code>grep -B 2 TTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGT * &gt; good-data.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The prompt should sit there a little bit, and then it should look like nothing
happened. But type <code>ls</code>. You should have a new file called good-data.txt. Take
a look at it and see if it has what you think it should.</p>

<p>There’s one more useful redirection command that we’re going to show, and that’s
called the pipe command, and it is <code>|</code>. It’s probably not a key on
your keyboard you use very much. What <code>|</code> does is take the output that
scrolling by on the terminal and then can run it through another command.
When it was all whizzing by before, we wished we could just slow it down and
look at it, like we can with <code>less</code>. Well it turns out that we can! We pipe
the <code>grep</code> command through <code>less</code></p>

<pre><code>grep TTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGT * | less
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can use the arrows to scroll up and down and use <code>q</code> to get out.</p>

<p>We can also do something tricky and use the command <code>wc</code>. <code>wc</code> stands for
<code>word count</code>. It counts the number of lines or characters. So, we can use
it to count the number of lines we’re getting back from our <code>grep</code> command.
And that will magically tell us how many sequences we’re finding. We’re</p>

<pre><code>grep TTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGT * | wc
</code></pre>

<p>That tells us the number of lines, words and characters in the file. If we
just want the number of lines, we can use the <code>-l</code> flag for <code>lines</code>.</p>

<pre><code>grep TTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGT * | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>Redirecting is not super intuitive, but it’s really powerful for stringing
together these different commands, so you can do whatever you need to do.</p>

<p>The philosophy behind these command line programs is that none of them
really do anything all that impressive. BUT when you start chaining
them together, you can do some really powerful things really
efficiently. If you want to be proficient at using the shell, you must
learn to become proficient with the pipe and redirection operators:
<code>|</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-moving-copying-and-removing">Creating, moving, copying, and removing</h2>

<p>Now we can move around in the file structure, look at files, search files,
redirect. But what if we want to do normal things like copy files or move
them around or get rid of them. Sure we could do most of these things
without the command line, but what fun would that be?! Besides it’s often
faster to do it at the command line, or you’ll be on a remote server
like Amazon where you won’t have another option.</p>

<p>The stability.files file is one that tells us what sample name
goes with what sequences. This is a really important file, so
we want to make a copy so we don’t lose it.</p>

<p>Lets copy the file using the <code>cp</code> command. The <code>cp</code>
command backs up the file. Navigate to the <code>data</code> directory and enter:</p>

<pre><code>cp stability.files stability.files_backup
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>stability.files_backup</code> has been created as a copy of <code>stability.files</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s make a <code>backup</code> directory where we can put this file.</p>

<p>The <code>mkdir</code> command is used to make a directory. Just enter <code>mkdir</code>
followed by a space, then the directory name.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir backup
</code></pre>

<p>We can now move our backed up file in to this directory. We can
move files around using the command <code>mv</code>. Enter this command:</p>

<pre><code>mv stability.files_backup backup/
</code></pre>

<p>This moves <code>stability.files_backup</code> into the directory <code>backup/</code> or
the full path would be <code>~/edamame-data/shell/MiSeq/backup</code></p>

<p>The <code>mv</code> command is also how you rename files. Since this file is so
important, let’s rename it:</p>

<pre><code>mv stability.files stability.files_IMPORTANT
</code></pre>

<p>Now the file name has been changed to stability.files_IMPORTANT. Let’s delete
the backup file now:</p>

<pre><code>rm backup/stability.files_backup
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rm</code> file removes the file. Be careful with this command. It doesn’t
just nicely put the files in the Trash. They’re really gone.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Short Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rename the <code>stability.files_IMPORTANT</code> file to <code>stability.files</code>.</li>
  <li>Create a directory in the <code>MiSeq</code> directory called <code>new</code></li>
  <li>Then, copy the <code>stability.files</code> file into <code>new</code></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>By default, <code>rm</code>, will NOT delete directories. You can tell <code>rm</code> to
delete a directory using the <code>-r</code> option. Let’s delete that <code>new</code> directory
we just made. Enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>rm -r new
</code></pre>

<h2 id="writing-files">Writing files</h2>

<p>We’ve been able to do a lot of work with files that already exist, but what
if we want to write our own files. Obviously, we’re not going to type in
a FASTA file, but you’ll see as we go through other tutorials, there are
a lot of reasons we’ll want to write a file, or edit an existing file.</p>

<p>To write in files, we’re going to use the program <code>nano</code>. We’re going to create
a file that contains the favorite grep command so you can remember it for later. We’ll name this file
‘awesome.sh’.</p>

<pre><code>nano awesome.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have something that looks like</p>

<p><img src="img/shell/nano1.png" alt="nano1.png" /></p>

<p>Type in your command, so it looks like</p>

<p><img src="img/shell/nano2.png" alt="nano2.png" /></p>

<p>Now we want to save the file and exit. At the bottom of nano, you see the “^X Exit”. That
means that we use Ctrl-X to exit. Type <code>Ctrl-X</code>. It will ask if you want to save it. Type <code>y</code> for yes.
Then it asks if you want that file name. Hit ‘Enter’.</p>

<p>Now you’ve written a file. You can take a look at it with less or cat, or open it up again and edit it.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Open ‘awesome.sh’ and add “echo AWESOME!” after the grep command and save the file.</p>

<p>We’re going to come back and use this file in just a bit.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="running-programs">Running programs</h2>

<p>Commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>echo</code>, and <code>cd</code> are just ordinary programs
on the computer. A program is just a file that you can <em>execute</em>. The
program <code>which</code> tells you the location of a particular program. For
example:</p>

<pre><code>which ls
</code></pre>

<p>Will return “/bin/ls”. Thus, we can see that <code>ls</code> is a program that
sits inside of the <code>/bin</code> directory. Now enter:</p>

<pre><code>which find
</code></pre>

<p>You will see that <code>find</code> is a program that sits inside of the
<code>/usr/bin</code> directory.</p>

<p>So … when we enter a program name, like <code>ls</code>, and hit enter, how
does the shell know where to look for that program? How does it know
to run <code>/bin/ls</code> when we enter <code>ls</code>. The answer is that when we enter
a program name and hit enter, there are a few standard places that the
shell automatically looks. If it can’t find the program in any of
those places, it will print an error saying “command not found”. Enter
the command:</p>

<pre><code>echo $PATH
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out the value of the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. More
on environment variables later. Notice that a list of directories,
separated by colon characters, is listed. These are the places the
shell looks for programs to run. If your program is not in this list,
then an error is printed. The shell ONLY checks in the places listed
in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>Navigate to the <code>shell</code> directory and list the contents. You will
notice that there is a program (executable file) called <code>hello.sh</code> in
this directory. Now, try to run the program by entering:</p>

<pre><code>hello.sh
</code></pre>

<p>You should get an error saying that hello.sh cannot be found. That is
because the directory <code>/home/username/edamame-data/shell</code> is not in the
<code>PATH</code>. You can run the <code>hello.sh</code> program by entering:</p>

<pre><code>./hello.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that <code>.</code> is a shortcut for the current working
directory. This tells the shell to run the <code>hello.sh</code> program which is
located right here. So, you can run any program by entering the path
to that program. You can run <code>hello.sh</code> equally well by specifying:</p>

<pre><code>/home/username/edamame-data/shell/hello.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Or by entering:</p>

<pre><code>~/edamame-data/shell/hello.sh
</code></pre>

<p>When there are no <code>/</code> characters, the shell assumes you want to look
in one of the default places for the program.</p>

<h2 id="writing-scripts">Writing scripts</h2>

<p>We know how to write files and run scripts, so I bet you can guess where
this is headed. We’re going to run our own script!</p>

<p>Go in to the ‘MiSeq’ directory where we created ‘awesome.sh’ before. Remember we wrote our
favorite grep command in there. Since we like it so much, we might want to run it
again, or even all the time. Instead of writing it out every time, we can just run it as
a script.</p>

<p>It’s a command, so we should just be able to run it. Give it try.</p>

<pre><code>./awesome.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Alas, we get <code>-bash: ./awesome.sh: Permission denied</code>. This is because we haven’t told
the computer that it’s a program. To do that we have to make it ‘executable’. We do this
by changing its mode. The command for that is <code>chmod</code> - change mode. We’re going to change the mode
of this file, so that it’s executable and the computer knows it’s OK to run it as a program.</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x awesome.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s try running it again</p>

<pre><code>./awesome.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Now you should have seen some output, and of course, it’s AWESOME!
Congratulations, you just created your first shell script! You’re set to rule the world.</p>

<h1 id="for-future-reference">For Future Reference</h1>

<h1 id="finding-files">Finding files</h1>

<p>The <code>find</code> program can be used to find files based on arbitrary
criteria. Navigate to the <code>data</code> directory and enter the following
command:</p>

<pre><code>find . -print
</code></pre>

<p>This prints the name of every file or directory, recursively, starting
from the current directory. Let’s exclude all of the directories:</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f -print
</code></pre>

<p>This tells <code>find</code> to locate only files. Now try these commands:</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f -name "*1*"
find . -type f -name "*1*" -or -name "*2*" -print
find . -type f -name "*1*" -and -name "*2*" -print
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>find</code> command can acquire a list of files and perform some
operation on each file. Try this command out:</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f -exec grep Volume {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>This command finds every file starting from <code>.</code>. Then it searches each
file for a line which contains the word “Volume”. The <code>{}</code> refers to
the name of each file. The trailing <code>\;</code> is used to terminate the
command.  This command is slow, because it is calling a new instance
of <code>grep</code> for each item the <code>find</code> returns.</p>

<p>A faster way to do this is to use the <code>xargs</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f -print | xargs grep Volume
</code></pre>

<p><code>find</code> generates a list of all the files we are interested in,
then we pipe them to <code>xargs</code>.  <code>xargs</code> takes the items given to it
and passes them as arguments to <code>grep</code>.  <code>xargs</code> generally only creates
a single instance of <code>grep</code> (or whatever program it is running).</p>
