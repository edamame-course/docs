###Back in the saddle
Welcome back!

Previously, we left off with quality-controlled merged Illumina paired-end sequences, picked OTUs and an alignment of the representative sequences from those OTUs.
1.  **Assign taxonomy to representative sequences**
Navigate into the QIIMETutorial directory using `cd`, and, if you are on a Mac, call `macqiime` to enter the QIIME environment.  We will use the RDP classifier with a greengenes 16S rRNA reference database (both default options in QIIME).  This script will take a few minutes to run on a lap-top.

```
assign_taxonomy.py -i cdhit_rep_seqs/cdhit_rep_seqs.fasta -m rdp -c 0.8
```










Filter OTU table
```
filter_otus_by_sample.py -i  cdhit_picked_otus/combined_seqs_otus.txt  -f combined_fasta/combined_seqs.fna -s pynast_aligned/cdhit_rep_seqs_failures_names.txt
```
