Mac OS & Linux Users, connecting to your Amazon EC2 instance at the command line is pretty easy.

 1. Open a Terminal:
**MAC Users:** Terminal is under: Applications --> Utilities
**Linux Users:** Press Ctrl + Alt + t

You will need to know the location of your **key pair** you created when you launched your instance.  Usually this will be in your "Downloads" folder, but you may want to move it elsewhere.

You will need to know what your Public DNS is for your EC2 Instance.

 2. Enter the following command into the terminal:

```
chmod 400 **/path/to/your/key/**EDAMAME.pem
```
 3. Enter the following command into the terminal:

```
ssh -i **/path/to/your/key/**EDAMAME.pem ubuntu@ec2-**UNIQUE SET OF NUMBERS**.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

4. SUCCESS! You have now logged into your computer in the cloud!
