###Creating an OTU table
Welcome back, Microbe Enthusiasts!

Previously, we left off with quality-controlled merged Illumina paired-end sequences, picked OTUs and an alignment of the representative sequences from those OTUs.


** 3.1  Assign taxonomy to representative sequences**

Navigate into the QIIMETutorial directory using `cd`, and, enter the QIIME environment. We will use the RDP classifier with a greengenes 16S rRNA reference database (both default options in QIIME).  This script will take a few minutes to run on a lap-top. Documentation is [here](http://qiime.org/scripts/assign_taxonomy.html).

```
assign_taxonomy.py -i cdhit_rep_seqs/cdhit_rep_seqs.fasta -m rdp -c 0.8
```
Navigate into the new rdp_assigned_taxonomy directory and inspect the head of the tax_assignments file.
```
head cdhit_rep_seqs_tax_assignments.txt
```

This assignment file is used anytime an OTU ID (the number) needs to be linked with its taxonomic assignment.
*Note* that this list of OTUs and taxonomic assignments includes our "failed-to-align" representative sequences.  We will remove these at the next step.

3.2  Make an OTU table and append the assigned taxonomy





Filter OTU table
```
filter_otus_by_sample.py -i  cdhit_picked_otus/combined_seqs_otus.txt  -f combined_fasta/combined_seqs.fna -s pynast_aligned/cdhit_rep_seqs_failures_names.txt
```
