###Introduction to R tutorial by Stuart Jones, University of Notre Dame

*  Download the input files for the tutorial [here](https://github.com/edamame-course/docs/tree/gh-pages/extra/Jones_R_Tutorial_Files?raw=true)

*  Here is a link to Stuart's BioStats [course](http://www.nd.edu/~sjones20/JonesUND/BioStats.html)

*  How to find help with R:  [R seek: the Google for R questions](http://www.rseek.org/)

*  Helpful Vignettes for the vegan Package:  [Design Decisions](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/decision-vegan.pdf?raw=true); [Diversity](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/diversity-vegan.pdf?raw=true); [Ordination](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/intro-vegan.pdf?raw=true)

###Books that Stuart recommends:  

*  Nicholas J. Gotelli - A Primer of Ecology (Second Edition - Sinauer)  

*  Norman Matloff - The Art of R Programming - a tour of statistical software design (No Starch Press)

*  Pierre & Louis Legendre - Numerical Ecology (Green Bible) (Elsivier)  

*  Emmanuel Paradis - Analysis of Phylogenetics and Evolution with R (Springer R Series)  

*  M. Henry H. Stevens - A Primer of Ecology with R (Springer R Series)  

*  Borcard et al. Numerical Ecology with R (Springer R Series)  


###Continuing in R
*  Here is a [primer](https://edamame-course.github.io/docs/moving_data_into_R.html) on how to get files out of one program (QIIME/mothur) and in to R.
*  Here are [tutorials and a presentation (by Ashley)](https://github.com/edamame-course/docs/tree/gh-pages/extra/Shade_R_Tutorial/) for analysis of community patterns in R.  There is a bit of overlap with Stuart's, but there are also some tips for getting QIIME data into R.  The Day 5 lecture and tutorial continue with determining OTUs that contribute to particular patterns.
