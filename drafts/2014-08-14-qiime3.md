##4.1 Make resemblance matrices for analyses of beta-diversity
We will make three kinds of resemblance matrices (sample by sample comparisons) for assessing comparative diversity.

```
beta_diversity.py -s
```

```
beta_diversity.py -i Schloss_otu_table_even2212.biom -m unweighted_unifrac,weighted_unifrac,binary_sorensen_dice,bray_curtis -o beta_div_even2212/ -t fasttree_cdhit/fasttree_cdhit.tre
```

There should be four new resemblance matrices in the new directory.  Use nano to open these and inspect them, and to compare their results.  Remember the differences in weighted and unweighted metrics, as well as in phylogenetic and taxonomic metrics.

```
nano binary_sorensen_dice_Schloss_otu_table_even2212.txt
```

```
nano bray_curtis_Schloss_otu_table_even2212.txt
```

```
nano weighted_unifrac_Schloss_otu_table_even2212.txt
```

```
nano unweighted_unifrac_Schloss_otu_table_even2212.txt
```

##4.2 Using QIIME for visualizing differences in samples
