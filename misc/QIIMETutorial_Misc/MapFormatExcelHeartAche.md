###Formatting Heartache, part 1:  Invisible cells in ExcelIn my experience, file or text formatting is the number one issue with analyses for new learners.  If you are having trouble with any step, stop, look at the input file, and compare it very carefully to the tutorial file.  Spaces, tabs, hashes #, etc. must be exactly replicated.  Excel also is problematic because sometimes there are invisible cells to the right or to the bottom of your data fields that create an error.  In this case, QIIME will output a folder and a log file that will read:```# Errors and warnings are written as a tab separated columns, with the first column showing the error or warning, and the second column contains the location of the error or warning, written as row,column, where 0,0 is the top left header item (SampleID).  Problems not specific to a particular data cell will be listed as having 'no location'.Errors -----------------------------Warnings ---------------------------Data field  found after Description column	1,7Data field  found after Description column	1,8Data field  found after Description column	2,7Data field  found after Description column	2,8```My work around for this kind of "Excel" error is to:1. Open the map file in excel2. Select and copy only the cells with data3. Paste it into a brand new document and save under a new name, tab-delimited text.4. Then, delete the original text file.5.  May the force be with you!
